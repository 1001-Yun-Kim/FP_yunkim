At first, I used Azure but I been having a issue with password.
I changed my password then tried but still didn't work.

So I used Github action & Docker Hub. I will list steps I did.

1. Create Docker Account
2. create repository in github
3. push codes to github repository
4. create docker file
5. create .yml file in .github/workflow
  - build automated testing
  - build automated deployment
6. create requirements
7. set up secrets : setting- secrets - actions 
   - DOCKER_USERNAME
   - DOCKER_PASSWORD
8. run workflows

// I got stuck on stage 8. 
I even create new projects and tried again, it still doesn't work. 

Eventhough I didn't succeed my project, 
I learned a lot about git action, git worflows and Docker.
I am not familiar with python and git hub.
I liked coding with python because it is much simpler 
and working through git hub was good experience.
